# FLINT Documentation

Welcome to the FLINT (Fortran Library for INTegrated Thermochemistry) documentation.

## Quick Links

- **[Getting Started](QUICKSTART.md)** – Run your first simulation in 5 minutes
- **[Theoretical Guide](ALGORITHMS.md)** – Mathematical descriptions and solution methods
- **[Input File Format](INPUT_FORMATS.md)** – How to write input data files
- **[Examples](TEST_CASES.md)** – Validation case library and interpretation guide

## Documentation Layers

### Theoretical Guide  
Understand the mathematical foundations: Chemical Equilibrium Analysis (CEA), finite-rate kinetics, transport property computation, and thermodynamic property evaluation.

### Input File Format
Learn how to define the input files. Covers species definitions, reactions, transport properties, and thermodynamics.

### Examples
Browse the validation test suite. Each test case shows what is being validated, expected ranges, how to run it, and how to interpret results.
