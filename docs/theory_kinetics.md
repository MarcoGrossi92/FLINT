# Chemistry - Finite-Rate Kinetics

## Overview

FLINT computes mass source terms for species concentrations in chemically reacting flows, accounting for elementary, three-body, and pressure-dependent reactions. The finite-rate chemistry model captures non-equilibrium chemical kinetics essential for combustion, hypersonic flows, and plasma applications.

## Mathematical Formulation

The rate of change of molar concentration $c_i$ for species $i$ is governed by contributions from all reactions:

$$
\frac{dc_i}{dt} = \sum_{r=1}^{N_r} \nu_{i,r} R_r
$$

where:

- $c_i$ = molar concentration of species $i$ (mol/m³)
- $\nu_{i,r} = \nu'_{i,r} - \nu''_{i,r}$ = net stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $r$
- $\nu''_{i,r}$ = stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ as a reactant
- $\nu'_{i,r}$ = stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ as a product
- $R_r$ = rate of progress for reaction $r$ (mol/(m³·s))
- $N_r$ = total number of reactions

For a general elementary reaction: $\sum_{i=1}^{N_s} \nu''_{i,r} X_i \rightleftharpoons \sum_{i=1}^{N_s} \nu'_{i,r} X_i$

## Reaction Rate (Arrhenius)

The rate of progress for reaction $r$ follows the **modified Arrhenius form** [1,2]:

$$
R_r = k_{f,r}(T) \prod_{j=1}^{N_s} c_j^{\nu''_{j,r}} - k_{b,r}(T) \prod_{j=1}^{N_s} c_j^{\nu'_{j,r}}
$$

where the forward rate coefficient is:

$$
k_{f,r}(T) = A_r T^{b_r} \exp\left(-\frac{E_{a,r}}{R_u T}\right)
$$

**Parameters:**

- $A_r$ = pre-exponential factor (units depend on reaction order)
- $b_r$ = temperature exponent (dimensionless)
- $E_{a,r}$ = activation energy (J/mol or cal/mol)
- $R_u$ = universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))
- $T$ = temperature (K)

The backward rate coefficient $k_{b,r}(T)$ is computed from thermodynamic equilibrium:

$$
k_{b,r}(T) = \frac{k_{f,r}(T)}{K_{c,r}(T)}
$$

where $K_{c,r}(T)$ is the equilibrium constant in concentration units [3].

## Pressure-Dependent Reactions

### Three-Body Reactions

Three-body (or chaperon) reactions involve a collision partner $M$ that stabilizes an excited intermediate without being consumed [4]:

$$
A + B + M \rightleftharpoons AB + M
$$

The effective concentration of the third body is:

$$
[M] = \sum_{j=1}^{N_s} \alpha_{j,r} c_j
$$

where $\alpha_{j,r}$ is the third-body efficiency of species $j$ in reaction $r$. The reaction rate includes this effective concentration in the appropriate stoichiometric position.

### Lindemann Reactions (Falloff Behavior)

**Lindemann reactions** describe the transition between low-pressure (termolecular) and high-pressure (bimolecular) kinetics [5,6]. These are also known as unimolecular dissociation/recombination reactions or pressure falloff reactions.

**Physical mechanism:**
At low pressures, the reaction rate is limited by collisional activation/deactivation and is proportional to pressure (third-order kinetics). At high pressures, all molecules are in steady-state equilibrium with the excited state, and the reaction becomes pressure-independent (second-order kinetics) [7].

**Rate expression:**
$$
k_r(T, P) = k_{\infty,r}(T) \left(\frac{P_r}{1 + P_r}\right) F_r
$$

where:

- $k_{\infty,r}(T)$ = high-pressure limit rate coefficient
- $k_{0,r}(T)$ = low-pressure limit rate coefficient
- $P_r$ = reduced pressure (dimensionless):
  $$
  P_r = \frac{k_{0,r}(T) [M]}{k_{\infty,r}(T)}
  $$
- $[M]$ = effective third-body concentration
- $F_r$ = broadening factor (accounts for deviations from simple Lindemann theory)

**Limiting behavior:**

- **Low pressure** ($P_r \ll 1$): $k_r \approx k_{0,r}[M]$ (third-order)
- **High pressure** ($P_r \gg 1$): $k_r \approx k_{\infty,r}$ (second-order)

### Troe Formulation

The **Troe formulation** provides an empirical broadening factor $F_r$ that better matches experimental falloff curves than the simple Lindemann form [8,9]:

$$
\log_{10} F_r = \frac{\log_{10} F_{\text{cent},r}}{1 + \left[\frac{\log_{10} P_r + c}{n - d(\log_{10} P_r + c)}\right]^2}
$$

where:

$$
F_{\text{cent},r} = (1-a) \exp(-T/T^{***}) + a \exp(-T/T^*) + \exp(-T^{**}/T)
$$

and the parameters are:

- $a, T^*, T^{**}, T^{***}$ = Troe parameters (fitted to experimental data)
- $c = -0.4 - 0.67 \log_{10} F_{\text{cent},r}$
- $n = 0.75 - 1.27 \log_{10} F_{\text{cent},r}$
- $d = 0.14$

**Simplified Troe form** (three-parameter):
When $T^{**} \to \infty$: $F_{\text{cent},r} = (1-a) \exp(-T/T^{***}) + a \exp(-T/T^*)$

**Note:** For simple Lindemann falloff (no Troe correction), set $F_r = 1$.
